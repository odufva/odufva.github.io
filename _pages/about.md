I am a physician and a PhD student in the [Hematology Research Unit](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/hematology-research-unit-helsinki), the lab of Satu Mustjoki at the University of Helsinki, Finland. In my research, I try to understand immune responses to blood cancers using functional genomics and systems biology for developing more effective immunotherapies.
